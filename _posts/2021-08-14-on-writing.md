I have always identified as a creative and even sometimes artist, but struggled to put my work and thoughts "out there" for the world to see. My pursuits are often self-motivated journeys of learning and entertainment: internal missions to follow curiousity wherever leads me.

However, I've recently found great energy and benefit from building community around ideas, sharing perspectives openly, and engaging more publicly. So this blog and personal site will be my space to explore ideas in more depth, and share what I've been working on.

I'll write mostly about complex systems, organization design, and my observations of technology changing human interaction. Here goes my journey of mind to machine, to network, to you. I hope you enjoy along with me.
