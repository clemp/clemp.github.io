Hello, I'm Christian Lemp.

I work as a Director of Data Engineering at [The Hartford Financial Services Group](https://www.thehartford.com/) in Claims Data Science. My focus there is three main areas:
    
- delivering a large portfolio of data pipelines and models that integrate real-time decision analytics into business operations
- leading a team of data engineers, computer sciences, and analysts to develop meaningful careers and personal growth
- influencing our own workflow and department culture to be remote-friendly, efficient, and flexible

I am a PhD student in [Systems Science](https://www.binghamton.edu/apps/academics/program/gd/systems-science) at [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/). In 2021 I joined the [Center for Collective Dynamics of Complex Systems (CoCo Lab)](http://coco.binghamton.edu/), where I will research simulation, modeling, and complexity science of organizations. My PhD advisor is [Dr. Hiroki Sayama](http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~sayama/).

Santa Fe, NM is home, where I live with my wife, dog, and cat. After being born and raised in NY and the east coast, I moved to Santa Fe in 2019 via road trip and a dream.
